# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

About my website- If you get in with the same name which you have already used the existing data will be there 
And you also have option to delete the data permanently after going to the block drop area 
The status of the data can also be seen in the data base that it is in which drop area for eg is it in completed blocked or in process.
